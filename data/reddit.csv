Hello mixologists and liquor enthusiasts. Welcome to the monthly original cocktail competition.

For those looking to participate, here are the rules and guidelines. Any violations of these rules will result in disqualification from this month's competition.

1. You must use both of the listed ingredients, but you can use them in absolutely any way or form (e.g. a liqueur, infusion, syrup, ice, smoke, etc.) you want and in whatever quantities you want. You do not have to make ingredients from scratch. You may also use any other ingredients you want.

2. Your entry must be an original cocktail. Alterations of established cocktails are permitted within reason.

3. You are limited to one entry per account.

4. Your entry must include a **name** for your cocktail, a **photograph** of the cocktail, a **description** of the scent, flavors, and mouthfeel of the cocktail, and most importantly a list of **ingredients** with **measurements** and **directions** as needed for someone else to faithfully recreate your cocktail. You may optionally include other information such as ABV, sugar content, calories, a backstory, etc.

5. All recipes must have been invented after the announcement of the required ingredients.

---

**Please only make top-level comments if you are making an entry.** Doing otherwise would possibly result in flooding the comments section. To accommodate the need for a comments section unrelated to any specific entry, [**I have made a single top-level comment that you can reply to for general discussion.**](https://old.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/11gthp5/original_cocktail_competition_march_2023_radish/jaq5ivv/) You may, of course, reply to any existing comment.

---

How you upvote is entirely up to you. You are absolutely encouraged to recreate the shared drinks, but this may not always be possible or viable and so should not be considered as a requirement. You can vote based on the list of ingredients and how the drink is described, the photograph, or anything else you like.

#Do not downvote entries

Winners will be final at the end of the month at 23:59:59 EST and will be recorded with links to their entries in this post. You may continue voting after that, but the results will not change. There are 1st place, 2nd place, and 3rd place positions. 2nd place and 3rd place may receive ties, but in the event of a 1st place tie, I will act as a tie-breaker. I will otherwise withhold from voting. Should there be a tie for 2nd place, there will be no 3rd place.

3,The Bloodyless Mary,"I was unsurprisingly craving a Bloody Mary one day, but ultimately wanted to create a show stopper. I juiced and seasoned. I strained and spun (in a centrifuge). Ultimately, I came up with a fantastic Bloody, however for a bar or restaurants menu, this was too much work to complete on a regular basis. Furthermore, I strongly believe that a bloody mary is, ""just a mixy"", or at least should be. Back to the drawing board.

Of course I came to Reddit for inspiration and found a post by u/the_madeline in which they milk punch and clarify a bloody mary. Genius! We recreate their exact recipe among a couple other punchs for comparison (we used Zing Zang and Clamato for the two other versions). We were close, oh so close!

The final recipe, which is pictured here, went for a base mix comprised of 75% Clamato and 25% Master of Mixes (Zing Zang was too... Zingy). We did an initial spin with a coagulant to get rid of the big pieces and then mixed a bacon-fat washed vodka into the clearer mixture. 

Given how acidic the Clamato juice is by itself, we really didn't need to play with acidity, although I did add just a scootch of pickle brine before adding whole milk. Letting that sit over night, we strained the mixture through a coffee filter and voila! 

The recipe is:
3.5 Bloody/Clamato mixture
1.5 Bacon-fat washed vodka
An eyeball of pickle brine

Poured directly into a Collins glass and garnished with a pickle.

12,When cocktail recipes ask for Cranberry Juice - What kind do they mean?,"Do they mean 100% cranberry juice? 

Or would Ocean Spray Cranberry Drink (which says that it consists of 21% Cranberry concentrate and the rest is water, carrot juice and other things if I remember correctly) be preferable?

&amp;#x200B;

As far as I know, you're usually supposed to dilute and sweeten the 100% cranberry juice, if you decide to use that one, but how do I know how much sweetening and dilution is needed? Does it vary from cocktail to cocktail?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm asking because I tried to make a Cosmopolitan with...mixed results... a few weeks ago and I suspect that it might've been due to the random brand cranberry juice I bought, which tasted like nothing at all. It somehow managed to taste more neutral than water.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd be happy to read your input, as Ive been to multiple stores looking for the right cranberry juice by now and never knew what kind to pick.

19,Ban on Nitrous Oxide - how will British mixologists survive?,"Recently, the British government has announced it wants to ban nitrous oxide (make possession illegal):

[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65085987](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65085987)

The intent is to stop people (typically minors) abusing the substance recreationally in search of a legal high. This can lead to very severe health effects, and some are also concerned over the negetive effects this usage has on the urban environment (littering, noise, etc.). This move has generated some controversy, with the opposition claiming that it is too little and to late. It has also been pointed out to the government (and rightly so) that this is needlessly heavy-handed and will punish legitimate uses of the substance - nitrous oxide is sometimes used as an anaesthetic, and, as I'm sure most of us here are aware, for creating whipped cream, and for stabilising egg white based foams (e.g. in an ISI). 

Assuming the worst (that this law does go into effect), can a British mixologist continue to generate stable foams for craft cocktails using some other method, or is nitrous oxide always required?

It will suck enormously if the authoritarian police state I live under gets to arbitrarily dictate how I may experiment in my hobby!",2,2023-03-30 09:35:31

21,Original cocktail I just threw together for the first time called the Mercury. Turned out amazing,"- 30ml / 1oz Mezcal
- 22.5ml / ¾ oz Angostura aromatic bitters
- 22.5ml / ¾ oz Ginger syrup 
- 22.5ml / ¾ oz Lemon juice
- 1 red chilli
Shake all ingredients with ice and double strain

The ginger syrup is approx 1.5:1 and is made by blending the ginger directly with sugar and water, meaning it’s got a powerful ginger flavour and heat. 

For something I improvised on the fly it turned out amazing, and there’s not much I could pinpoint to improve apart from potentially adding less Mezcal and the fact that an entire chilli is a *lot*. That’s up to your tolerance I guess, but it’s intended to be a fiery drink.",1,2023-03-30 13:08:21

41,Help creating a cocktail from a memory.,"Many many moons ago, probably around a decade ago, I attended a mezcal event in San Antonio. 

The event showed off agave spirits from all across Mexico, and the restaurant (The Monterey for any locals) was divided into different regions to showcase the differences in food and the spirits. 

There’s were two beverages I had, both from the same person, that have been in my head for years. If memory serves me right she won the SACC that year.

One was a bell pepper tequila cocktail, and one was a pico de gallo mezcal cocktail. 

We chatted and I picked her brain, but she didn’t want to give me any real information on how to make the cocktail for myself.

Cab anyone point me in a general direction to start recreating these for myself?

There was a post about a tomato, mezcal cocktail the other that has brought this all back to me.

42,"Freezer cocktail, total water-added or total non-alcohol content?","Hey folks, trying to wrap my head around the important bits for freezer cocktails and one thing seems a little ambiguous/confusing for specs that I hoped I could clear up. I typically see 20% dilution quoted for cocktail batch specs, but I would have imagined it'd be the total alcohol content which is truly important(so that it doesn't freeze). For illustration purposes I'll assume gin of 80 proof, vermouth/campari at 40 proof(to make maths easier)

(per cocktail in batch)

2 to 1 Martini:

* 2 oz gin(.8 oz alcohol)
* 1 oz vermouth(.2 oz alcohol)
* .75 oz water
* 1 oz alcohol per 3.75 oz \~ 26.67% abv

1 to 1 Martini:

* 1.5 oz gin(.6 oz alcohol)
* 1.5 oz vermouth(.3 oz alcohol)
* .75 oz water
* .9 oz alcohol per 3.75 oz \~ 24% abv

Negroni:

* 1 oz gin(.4 oz alcohol)
* 1 oz vermouth(.2 oz alcohol)
* 1 oz campari (.2 oz alcohol)
* .75 oz water
* .8 oz alcohol per 3.75 oz \~ 21.3% abv

For freezer cocktails, should I really be keeping the 20% dilution consistent for all the cocktails, or should I actually be adjusting the dilution accordingly to keep the cocktails at a consistent abv?",2,2023-03-29 22:01:38
43,Making fruit syrups,"Hi!

The traditional way we do most of the fruit syrups is to boil them for a while with water and sugar, strain and voila, it's our syrup.

95,What can be added to cola drinks to improve them? generic or known brands.,"This could be something to make most cheap generic colas taste more like coca cola (or pepsi), or what is good to add to coke or pepsi -which may dramatically change the taste but is still a good addition.  


Preferably easy to source stuff, like vanilla. I have had some supermarket brands that listed hibiscus which I liked, not sure if it was due to it though. Or it could be things like sugar or glycerin/glycerol.",0,2023-03-28 18:07:20
96,How would you go about balancing this cocktail?,"* 2 parts vodka

1. Shake the above with ice and serve in a glass rimmed with fresh basil.

The idea behind this cocktail is to use flavours and ingredients common to Tashkent, Uzbekistan, where I live, so I am reluctant to add any new ingredients. At the moment, the drink is just lot a little cloyingly sweet, but when I cut down on the juice or syrup, I find the vodka hits too hard. Would be grateful for any tips on how to get it more balanced - I am really going for a light, refreshing, summery drink.",5,2023-03-28 05:18:28
97,Help Tweak a Shitty Recipe,"Hi, I'm trying to improve a recipe on Crown Royal's website because I have a bottle of Salted Caramel I need to use up. It's called the Caramel Apple. I pretty new to cocktail making and my palate is pretty inexperience yet so I don't even trust my own tongue, but does this recipe sound balanced/well done?

My specs: 

• 1 Oz. Crown Apple

• 1 Oz. Crown Salted Caramel

• 20 ML Fresh Lemon Juice

• 3 Oz. Fever Tree Ginger Beer

• 1 Dash Angostura Bitters 

• Garnish with Apple slice






Original Specs:

• 1 Oz. Crown Apple

• .75 Oz. Crown Salted Caramel

• .5 Oz. Fresh Lemon Juice

• 4 Oz. Ginger Ale

• Garnish with apple slice



The original was very sweet and light on the booze, so I added some bitters, reduced the mixer, upped the booze a smidge, and increased the lemon juice by 5 ML",0,2023-03-28 11:54:43
