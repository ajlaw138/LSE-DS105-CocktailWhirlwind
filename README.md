## Motivation
Cocktails are great; they can be the start of a great night out, or a way to meet someone, or catch up with a friend. This is especially the case in London, 
with a thriving bar scene, amounting to £587 million in the UK in 2019 [1^]. By looking to capture this culture in data, we aim to identify price variations in 
cocktails across London, to help those looking for that perfect cocktail that is within their budget. Matching geo-located data with price data, we can
generate a tool that will help people find the right bar, that has the right cocktail. 

### How our project changed 
Our project was originally motivated by looking to understand trends in cocktail popularity, trying to understand which cocktails were in fashion, and what 
taste profiles were most popular. However, finding data sources proved difficult, and as such, our analysis moved towards analysing price variation instead, 
providing a tool that is aimed more towards consumers than businesses. It could still prove useful to bars, by providing a quick way to check cocktail prices 
in an area, so that they can stay competitive in the market. 


## Data Gathering Process
We used a variety of databases to collate information on cocktails, and bars. 
#### CocktailDB - API


#### Master of Malt - Web Scraping
Master of Malt is a UK distributor of various wines, spirits, and other alcohol and cocktail related ingredients. This website contains much valuable information 
on distributor prices, alcoholic content and volumes. By using BeautifulSoup4, the website can be scraped for this information, as it appears in a regular format. 
Thus, a function can be defined to retrieve important information amounting to a panda data frame.
