### Figure Folder :file_folder:

This folder is where all figures are saved. These are used for the data visualization techniques that will be produced, using ggplot, to produce a variety of graphs including:
- violin plots
- density curves
- box plots
- bar charts
- wordclouds

For the latter, the wordcloud library is used.
