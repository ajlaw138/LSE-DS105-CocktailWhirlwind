# Notebooks Folder :file_folder:

This folder contains the Jupyter Notebooks worked on by the team to combine data from different sources, and produce our cocktail insights.🍹

## Our process 

It will go in the following order:
1. Using APIs to pull the data 🤖
2. Cleaning the data e.g. removing duplciates, cleaning columns, removing outliers 🧮
3. Merging the data from different sources together ↔️
4. Producing insights based on these findings through a variety of visuals 📉

## Issues❗

Any issues with code, or extra requested features will be tracked in the issues tab ⚠️
